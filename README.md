# Simple Form Validation with JavaScript

Hey! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a small project I built to practice form validation using plain JavaScript. Itâ€™s a basic HTML form with fields for name, email, and password â€” and Iâ€™ve added some validation checks before letting the user continue.

## What it does

- Checks if the name field is empty
- Validates the email format
- Makes sure the password is at least 6 characters long (should include numbers/symbols)
- Shows alerts if anything's wrong and focuses on the problematic field
- If everythingâ€™s good, it redirects to `submit.html`

## How to try it

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the form
3. Hit the submit button

If anythingâ€™s missing or incorrect, youâ€™ll get an alert. Once all fields are valid, itâ€™ll take you to `submit.html`.
